# Welcome to Slime-Connect ðŸŽ‰
This repository contains a project I made on my own, during my 2nd year of Computer Science Bachelor. It was the second project I build in JS (the first full vanilla).
Although it may not follow all best practices, it represents an important step in my journey as a developer, and I'm very proud of it.
